Wellcome to my Flow App =)

Flow is an application designed for note-taking and turning them into visual graphs, making task and project management dynamic.

Users can transform their notes into two types of graphs: a pie chart and a mind map.

Tasks are organized into primary and secondary categories based on their priority level.

Additionally, each task is tagged, and those tags determine its location on the mind map.

A key feature of Flow is the ability to customize geometric shapes, which adapt to the type of project.

For example, tasks related to family can be represented by circles.

Work projects can be shown with triangles.

Tasks for children may be depicted as squares.

With Flow, managing tasks and projects becomes more visual and flexible, allowing users to adapt it to their needs and priorities.
